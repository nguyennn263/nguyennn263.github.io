## 3. Building Data Pipelines

One of the core objectives of the course was to learn how to build efficient and scalable data pipelines using Python.

**Key Concepts:**
- **ETL Processes:** Extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it to meet business needs, and loading it into target systems.
- **Task Automation:** Using libraries like `airflow` to schedule and manage workflows.
- **Error Handling:** Building resilient pipelines with proper logging and exception management.

**Practice:**
- Creating an ETL pipeline that fetches data from an API, transforms it using `pandas`, and uploads it to a PostgreSQL database.
- Automating pipeline execution with Apache Airflow.

## 7. Debugging and Optimization

The course placed a strong emphasis on debugging and optimizing Python code for better performance.

**Key Techniques:**
- Using `cProfile` and `line_profiler` to identify bottlenecks in scripts.
- Writing efficient loops and minimizing redundant computations.
- Leveraging parallel processing with `multiprocessing` and `concurrent.futures`.

**Exercises:**
- Debugging a malfunctioning ETL pipeline and optimizing its runtime by 40%.
- Comparing performance improvements using single-threaded vs multi-threaded approaches.
