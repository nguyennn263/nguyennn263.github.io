# Purpose of Writing the Blog
This series will review the knowledge about Machine Learning (ML) that I have learned. I also want to systematize my understanding in this field to better prepare for the future.

# What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of algorithms that can analyze and make predictions or decisions based on data.

# Types of Machine Learning
There are mainly three types: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning. Semi-supervised Learning is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning.

## 1. Supervised Learning
- Classification: e.g., spam detection, image recognition
- Regression: e.g., predicting house prices

## 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering: e.g., customer segmentation
- Trend detection: e.g., market basket analysis

## 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Game playing
- Robotic control

## 4. Semi-supervised Learning
- Text classification, web content classification

# Machine Learning applications
- Healthcare: Prediction disease, personalized medicine,...
- Finance: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading,...
- Retail: Recommendation systems, customer sentiment analysis,...
- Transportation: Autonomous vehicles, traffic prediction,...

# Conclusion
Thank you for you reading this post. In the next post, I will introduce the basic ML algorithms.
